# Ch 07: Preparations for a transformation begins in paradise

> A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It's only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. - Steven Pressfield

Most people stay the same their entire lives. Too frightened to leave the way they operated yesterday.

Be willing to do what it takes.

The life of a caterpillar must end for the flory of the butterfly to shine. The old 'you' must die before the best 'you' can be born.

Nature notices your effortful actions and then goes ahead and replies to your faithful commitment with a series of unanticipated wins. The flow of life rewards positive action and punishes hesitation.

Please consider that a bad day for the ego is a great day for the soul.

The humblest is the greatest. Pure leaders are so secure in their own skin that their main mission is the elevation of others. They don't need to advertise their success.

As long as you don't get brainwashed into defining your worth as a human being by the material things, enjoy them. Real power never comes from anything external. Real riches comes from living by the noble virtues of productivity, self-discipline, courage, honesty, empathy and integrity, as well as being able to lead your days on your own terms.

One of the primary aims of a wonderfully crafter life is contribution. Impact. Usefulness. Helpfulness. To lead is to serve. Give up the drop, become the ocean.

All pro athletes have peak performance coaches. You just can't get to iconic alone.

The 2x3x Mindset: to double your income and impact, triple your investment in two core areas - your personal mastery and your professional capability.

Reach maximum productivity, sustaining exceptional performance and creating a life you love by coding in a superior morning routing.

I show up here to renew and refuel. Elite production without quiet vacation causes lasting depletion. Rest and recovery isn't a luxury for anyone committed to mastery - it's a necessity.

Inspiration gets fed by isolation. We get our ideas that change the world when we're rested.

Anyone can be a critic. Takes guts to be an encourager.

Own your morning. Elevate your life.
