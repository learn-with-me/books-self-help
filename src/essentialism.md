# Essentialism

> **Theme**: The disciplined pursuit of less.

For every single thing that you say yes to, you'll have to say no to a bunch of other things. This means putting a lot of value to your `yes` and not being afraid to say `no`. You look for best places to put your effort that will yield the greatest results.

Essentialism advocates for focusing on what truly matters by eliminating non-essential distractions. Here's a summary:

1. **Focus on the Essential**: Essentialism emphasizes `identifying` and `prioritizing` what is truly important in your life or work. It's about discerning what really matters and saying no to everything else.

2. **Eliminate the Non-Essential**: Cut out non-essential activities, commitments, and possessions that don't contribute significantly to your goals or well-being. This creates `more space` for what truly matters.

3. **Say No, More Often**: Learning to say no to non-essential requests and distractions is crucial in embracing essentialism. It allows you to invest your time and energy in the `most valuable` pursuits.

4. **Create Space for What Matters**: By eliminating the clutter of non-essential activities and commitments, you create space to `focus deeply` on the things that bring the most `fulfillment` and `value` to your life.

Overall, essentialism is about simplifying your life, making deliberate choices, and focusing your efforts on the things that truly matter most to you.

## Summary

The author broke down the book in three sections:

### Explore

1. **Escape**: You need to `escape` to a place, where you can concentrate, design, read, to do deep thinking and deep work.
2. **Look**: Hone your observational skills and be a `journalist` of your own life
3. **Play**: Broaden your range of options by expanding your awareness. It's a clear antidote to stress.
4. **Sleep**: Protect the asset, your brain, otherwise quality of your effort and attention will steadily declines.
5. **Select**: Can't say yes to everything. Determine a metrics that helps you decide what gets your `yes`. Either bring `Hell yeah!` or `No`, there is no in-between.

### Eliminate

1. **Clarify**: the target you are shooting for. Without having your essential intent defined, it makes it a lot harder to decide what to say yes to and what to say no to.
2. **Dare**: to say no, even if it makes you unpopular. This can often mean trading `popularity` for `respect`. You need to say no firmly, resolutely and gracefully. It's worth getting good at saying no.
3. **Uncommit**: if you recognize the direction you are in is not getting you the desired results.
4. **Edit**: along the way to add quality to your life and to your work. This is where you from from being a `journalist` to being an `editor`, looking for opportunities to cut out anything that isn't essential so there's more space and attention give to most important.
5. **Limit**: your options upfront, to create `boundaries` in your life/work to give you a sense of `freedom`.

### Execute

1. **Buffer**: Create a buffer for `breathing room` between current focus and future commitment. Without this buffer, the quality of the effort will decline.
2. **Subtract**: Remove the `obstacles`. Take a closer look at the steps underlying creative process and remove the obstacles that make those steps difficult.
3. **Progress**: Instead of focusing on huge leaps of progress, build yourself a `system of small wins`. Steps that you can take each day that allow you to `start small` and `build momentum` over time.
4. **Flow**: As you build the system of small steps, look for the things that get you in a `state of flow`. Look for consistent routines that you can put in place for yourself.
5. **Focus**: Have a regular state of focused attention/energy, and to always be winning, asking the question `What's important Now?`.
6. **Be**: Live from the sense of essentialism, making it part of your core, and keep increasing that essentialist part of you.
