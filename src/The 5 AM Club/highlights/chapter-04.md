# Ch 04: Letting go of mediocrity and all that's ordinary

When it comes to relationships, I only surround myself with human beings who fuel my joy, stoke my peace and excite me to become a better man. Life's way too valuable to hang with people who don't get you. Who have different values and lower standards than you do.

Turn I cant's into I cans.

Done is better than perfect.

Your surrounding really do share your perceptions, your inspirations and your implementations. Art feeds my soul. Great books battle-proof my hope. Rich conversations magnify my creativity. Wonderful music uplifts my heart. Beautiful sights fortify my spirit.

Uplifting humankind is the master sport of business that the top 5% play.

Main focus in business is to serve. Money, power and prestige are just the inevitable by-products.

Most adults are deteriorated children.

Pain is the doorway into deep. And tragedy is nature's great purifier. It burns away the fakeness, fear and arrogance that is of the ego.

How could he be so articulate? Where did his dept come from? And who is this 'old friend' he says has taught him so much? He also has a warmth.

One who sweats more in training bleeds less in war.

High victory is made in those early morning hours when no one's watching and while everyone else is sleeping.

We only hear what we're ready to hear. All learnings meet us exactly where we're at. And as we grow greater, we understand better.

Install a world-class morning routine. Winning starts at your beginning. Take excellent care of the front end of your day, and the rest of your day will pretty much take care of itself.

Gargantum results are much less about your inherited genetics and far more about your daily habits.

We think their genius is inherited. Yet the truth is that we are watching them in their full blazing glory after years of following a process, one that involved ceaseless hours of practice. We are observing the earned results of a monomaniacal concentration around a single pursuit.

To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.

Most of us in this age spend our most valuable hours being busy chasing trivial pursuits and artificial amusements while neglecting living a real life. This is a formula for heartbreaks at the end.
What's the point of spending your best mornings and potentially productive days climbing mountains that your realize were the wrong ones when you are frail and wrinkled?

The job of the leader is to help disbelievers embrace your vision, the powerless to overcome their weakness and the hopeless to develop faith.

Letting go of employees who no longer fit where your business is now at - is normal part of growing a business. It happened because they failed to grow as your enterprise rose. They did it to themselves.

If everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.

Technology; if intelligently used, advances human progress. It is the misuse of technology that's ruining people's minds.

Pressure is a privilege - Billy Jean King, tennis legend

With every challenge comes the gorgeous opportunity to rise into your next level as a leader, performer and human being. Obstacles are nothing more than tests designed to measure how seriously you want the rewards that your ambitions seek.

To find the your best self you must lose your weak self. And that only happens through relentless improvement, continuous reflection and ongoing self-excavation.

Once we transform the primary relationship with ourselves. we'll find that our relationships with other people, our work, our income and our impact transform. Most people can't stand themselves.

I'm not anti-social. I'm just anti-moron.

Everything will be okay in the end. And if it's not ok, it's not the end.

The soreness of growth is much less expensive than the devastating costs of regret.

All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.

Everyday in life - you'll be faced with the chance of showing leadership. It's an arena everyone gets to play in. It's about committing to mastery over all you do - and in who you are. Leadership is about making a difference right where you're planted.
Never work only for the income. Labor for the impact.

The top 5% are a lot more invested in punching above their weight class _within their craft_, playing above their pay grade _around their talents_ and creating the kind of productivity that inspires and serves millions.

Wire a series of profound daily rituals and practice them until they become your second nature. How can you be world-class if you don't carve out some time each morning to make yourself world-class?

The way you begin your day really does determine the extent of focus, energy, excitement and excellence you bring to it.

Please do not allow past pains and present frustrations to diminish your glory, stifle your invincibility and choke the unlimited possibilitarian that lurks within the supreme part of you.
It's your job as a hero of your life.

The tru joy of life - being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations. - George Bernard Shaw
