# Ch 06: A flight to peak productivity, virtuosity and undefeatability

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the nouse of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. - Steve Jobs

But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winder training and prepare himself and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him. Volunatry discomfort. - Epictetus

5 AM. Everything is so peaceful at this time of the day. My attention isn't a mess.

Mr Riley - the most fascinating, generous and compassionate person I know. He also has incredible willpower, along with having ironclad values, such as honesty, empathy, integrity and loyalty.

Engraved, gold plated, 5 statements

1. Rule #1 - Addiction to distraction is the end of your creative production. Empire-makers and history-creators take one hour for themselves _before dawn_, in the serenity that lies beyond the clutches of complexity, to prepare themselves for a world-class-day
2. Rule #2 - Excuses breed no genius. Just because you haven't installed the early-rising habit before doesn't mean you can't do it now. Release your rationalizations and remember that small daily improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results.
3. Rule #3 - All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end. Everything you now find you first found difficult. With consistent practice, getting up with the sun will become your new normal. And automatic.
4. Rule #4 - To have the results the top 5% of producers have, you must start doing what 95% of hte people are unwilling to do. As you start to live like this, the majority will call you crazy. Remember that being labeled a freak is the price of greatness.
5. Rule #5 - Whe nyou feel like surrendering, continue. Triumph loves the relentless.
