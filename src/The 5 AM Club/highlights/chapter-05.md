# Ch 05: A bizarre adventure into morning mastery

> Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure... the skill to mold the mateiral into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Values few believe in these days, where so many have an entitlement mentality.
Nothing works for those who don't do the work.

Victims love entertainment. Victors adore education.

Only people whoe are capable of loving strongly can suffer great sorrow.

You can't win a game you don't play.

Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.

Nearly every morning, I envision my ideal performance for the day ahead.

Your DNA isn't your destiny.

Giving to other people is a gift you give to yourself.
Significance is rad. Generosity - not scarcity - is the trait of all the great men and women who have upgraded our world.
