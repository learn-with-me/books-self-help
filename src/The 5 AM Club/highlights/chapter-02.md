# Chapter 02: A daily philosophy on becoming legendary

> Do not allow your fire to go out. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists. It is possible. It is yours. - Ayn Rand

Lead masterful lives filled with creativity, productivity and prosperity. So at the end, they would feel confident they had left a wonderful legacy and made their mark on the generations that would follow.

Life's too short to play small with your talents.

Limitation is nothing more than a mentality that too many good people practice daily until they believe it's reality.
Remember, your excuses are seducers, your fears are liars and your doubts are thieves.

Living the same week a few thousand times and calling it a life, is not a life.

No matter where you are on the pathway of your life, please don't let the pain of an imperfect past hinder the glory of your fabulous future.
If you sense your life's a mess right now, this is simply because your fears are just a little stronger than your faith.

World-class begins where your comfort zone ends is a rule the successful, the influential and the happiest always remember.

Hard is good. Real greatness and the realization of your inherent genius is meant to be a difficult sport. Becoming legendary is never easy.

A major key to happiness - and internal peace - is knowing you've done whatever it took to earn your rewards and passionately invested the effortful audacity to become your best.

The place where your greatest discomfort lies is also the spot where your largest opportunity lives.
