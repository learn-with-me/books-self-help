# Deep Work

> **Theme**: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

## Philosophies

### Monastic approach

Involves elimination or radical reduction of shallow obligations, so that all that's left is depth. This approach works well for those who can identify high-value professional goal, where success comes from doing one thing exceptionally well.

### Bimodal approach

Divides your time in two modes: deep work and everything else.
You create clearly defined stretches for deep work (a few weeks or a few months) where you focus on that deep work, then you spend a few weeks attending to what you neglected. And go back forth in cycles.

### Rhythmic approach

Focuses on daily cycles, giving you the opportunity to turn deep work sessions into regular habit that occur at consistent times each day. This approach works well with the reality of human nature.

### Journalistic approach

Encourages you to fit in deep work whenever and wherever you can. Like a journalist in the field, you are always prepared to take advantage of the opportunities as they arise. This approach is not for the deep work novice.
