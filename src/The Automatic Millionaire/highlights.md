> To avoid getting overwhelmed, optionally break the chapter into sections: beginning, middle, and end.

The main takeaways from this book are:

- Having a plan is very very important. Nothing works without a plan.
- Forget discipline, budgeting, etc. All you need is automation. The author has stresed over this topic in his entire book.

## Introduction

Philosophy behind the Automatic Millionaire:

- You don't have to make a lot of money to be rich
- You don't need a discipline
- You don't need to be "your own boss"
- The Latte factor
- The rich get rich because they pay themselves first
- Homeowners get rich; renters get poor
- You'll need an automatic system, so you can't fail.

> If your financial plan is not automatic, you will fail.

## Chapter 1: Meeting the Automatic Millionaire

The trick to getting ahead financially free isn't being cheap and boring.

- We `don't do debt`.
- There is a `difference between looking rich and being rich`.
- Parents sat us down and told us (couple) together that we needed to `get serious with our lives`.
- Learn to `make money work for you` and really enjoy your life.
- Every time you earn a dollar, you should make sure to `pay yourself first`.
- Toss the bugget. Instead take 10 percent out of paycheck and put it in savings before you ever see it. The secret is that you can't spend what you don't see.
- Put aside enough down payment to own a home. Key is to owning it free and clear asap. `Pay off asap`. With either approach below, you'll pay a few years sooner:
    - Pay biweekly
    - Pay 10% extra with each payment
- `The Latte factor`. Stop wasting money on expensive coffee. Nothing against coffee.
- No matter what, never buy on credit. No matter how big they are, pay for your purchases with cash or you don't buy, unless it appreciates in value over time (like a home)
- If you need to use a card, `pay in full` each month
- Buy a `used vehicle`. Have it checked by a reliable mechanic. Let someone else pay for rapid asset depreciation that happens in first few years.
- Take the decision out of your hands. Arrange for transactions to happen automatically. If you don't have to think about it, there's no chance you'll forget to do it. Also once  the decision is out of your hands, there's no way you can be tempted into doing the wrong things. It's called `protecting yourself from yourself`.
- Just do it. Over time it adds up.
- Set yourself for success. Why make getting rich hard?

Priority: Retirement > Home

## Chapter 2: The Latte Factor

> More often than not, the more we make, the more we spend. Chances are that you're earning more than you were ten years ago. But are you saving more?

- How much you earn has no bearing on whether or not you can and will build wealth. When you spend everything you make, you subject yourself to a life of stress, fear, uncertainity, and debt.
- The latte factor
  - Most of us waste a lot of what we earn on `small things`. They add up. By saving these unnecessary expenses, you can get your money to work for you instead of you working for it.
  - If you don't drink coffee, assume you do.
  - If someone argues in 30 years a million may not be as worth - it will certainlly be a lot more than nothing
  - What matters is not how much you earn but how much you spend.
- To get new results, you need to take new actions.
- You need to act on what you've learned.
- Look at the [Time value of Money](./after-thoughts/index.md)

## Chapter 3: Learn to pay yourself

> The point of the latte factor isn't to convince you to put yourself on a budget. It's to make you realize that you already earn enough to start saving and investing

- Throw your budget out. Forget about budgeting.
    - Most people get sick of counting calories. They get sick of depriving themselves. Any system that is designed to control your normal human impulses is ultimately bound to fail.
    - We want to be in control
- Simply having heard of the concept doesn't mean you are living it.
    - Even more important, see if you are living what you know.
- When you earn a dollar, the first perons you pay is you.
    - Otherwise it may seem like everyone is getting paid but the person who earned the paycheck.
    - You need to set up a system that guarantees you'll get paid - a system in which you pay yourself automatically.
    - The issue with most financial planning systems is that they focus on numbers. Instead think about hours of your life. Measure savings by -
        - How many hours (by hourly income) did you work for yourself each paycheck?
        - How many hours do you want to spend today working for your future?
    - We are our first priority.
    - Lord helps those who help themselves
- A good 401k savings benchmark to shoot for is between 10-15 percent of your gross income. Even better if you could do 20 percent.
- You can think about this a little longer, or you can commit to yourself now to make it happen. Nothing will help you achieve wealth until you decide to pay yourself first. This is the foundation of building wealth.

## Chapter 4: Now make it automatic

- In order for pay yourself first to be effective, the process has to be automatic. You need to have a system that doesn't depend on your following a budget or being disciplined.
- How do you get a secure financial future?
    - Simple. You buy it, by committing yourself to invest the money you've decided to pay yourself in your future (401k)
- Max out your 401k if possible
- Automation + Compound interest = Serious wealth
    - Over time, money compounds.
    - Over a lot of time, money compounds dramatically!
    - Look at the power of pretax investing in [after thoughts](./after-thoughts/index.md)
- Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA
    - Money compounds pre-tax in traditional IRA, however you are required to withdraw the money by the time you reach the age 70 1/2. And who knows what the tax rate will be in future.
    - There is no tax to pay in Roth IRA on withdrawal. And you are not forced by the government to start taking money out at 70 1/2.
- Hire a `good financial advisor`.
- Managing your money should be `BORING`
- Remember to make it automatic

Note: Vanguard offers some of the lowest cost mutual funds in the industry.

### Self-employed people

Small businesses truly powers our economy. The government gives business owners the best tax breaks when it comes tor retirement accounts.

> If you are employed, as well as own a business, check with your accountant if you can use any of these approaches.

#### SEP IRA

`Simplified Employee Pension` is a self-employed retirement account. You an contribute as much as `25 percent` of your gross income, up to a maximum of `$66,000` as of 2023. To make the most out of it, you'll need to earn $264,000 a year from your business.

An ideal approach would be to pay yourself some salary, so you won't have to think about funding your account at the end of the year.

#### One-Participant 401k/Profit-Sharing plan

This plan is meant for a business with no employees other than yourself. You can fund it with up to `100 percent` of the first `$22,500` as of 2023. On top of that you can contribute another `25 percent` with combined total up to `$66,000` as of 2023.

This is why business owners get richer faster. It's hard work, but pays off well in the end.

### Diversify

It's critical that you invest wisely, and not gamble. Diversify. Spread it around between stocks, bonds and cash) in one retirement account. Note that the nature of this combination should change over time, balancing between aggressiveness, growth, and long-term outlook.

Invest in a `Asset Allocation Fund` or a `Balanced Fund`. Most of these funds have low expenses. Simplest way to do so is to select a fund closes to your projected retirement date.

During stressful times for market, historically, portfolios diversified among stocks, bonds and treasury bills nearly maintain its value.

> Remember: Losing money is more expensive than growing it. Always protect your capital.
