# Start with Why

Communication is not about speaking, it's about listening.

A clear sense of WHY sets expectations. When we don't know an organization's WHY, we don't know what to expect, so we expect the minimum - price, quality, service, features - the commodity stuff. But when we do have a sense for the WHY, we expect more.

Why invest good money and energy to go after people who, at the end of the day, will do business with you any way if you meet their practical requirements but will never be loyal if you don't?

Being authentic is not a requirement for success, but it is if you want that success to be a lasting success.
