## 40 Things I wish I'd known at 40

1. That family, flowers and walks in the woods would bring me more happiness than cars, watches and houses ever would.
2. That getting super-fit would multiple my creativity, productivity and prosperity considerably.
3. That your choice of relationship partner is one of the main sources of your success (or failure), joy (or misery), and tranquality (or worry).
4. That I'd do my finest work when Id be working in hotel rooms and flying airplanes rather than when chained to an office desk.
5. That good friendships are priceless treasures. And that old friends are the most precious ones.
6. That heaven helps those who help themselves. So do your best and let your higher power do the rest.
7. That people putting you down is a sign of yourr increasing success.
8. That the priorities I thought were most important in my youth are actually the pursuits I,m least interested in as I mature
9. That silcence, stillness and soluture for the sweet song that most attracts the Muse.
10. That small daily victories, performed with disciplined consistency over extended periiods of time, lead to revolutionary results.
11. That when I didn't get what I desired it was because the universe had something a whole lot better in mind.
12. That being scared just means you're about to grow. And that frequent discomfort is the price of accelerated progress.
13. That if you risk all for love and it doesn't work out, there is no failure because all love stories are, in truth, hero tales. And no growth of the heart is a waste. Ever.
14. That working diligently without concern for the rewards is the very behavior that brings the rewards.
15. That just because someone is aging doesn't mean they are growing.
16. That life has a fabulous feedback system showing you what you are doing right by where you are winning (and what you need to improve by where you're frustrated).
17. That it usually takes twenty years of working anonymously before you acquire wisdom and expertise required to know what to leave out of a piece of work so it becomes extraordinary.
18. That the humble the person, the stronger the character
19. That your income will never exceed your self-identity. And your impact will never be larger that your personal story.
20. That we get what we settle for. (So stop settling for what you don't want.)
21. That sometimes silesnse is the loudest reply you can give.
22. That the way people make you feel when you interact with them tells you everything you need to know about them.
23. That taking a lot of time off would make me twice as productive.
24. That feeding the trolls is a waste of your time. Most critics are jealous because you did what they couldn't do. Ignore them. And allow mastery to be your response.
25. That bullies become cowards once you stand up to them.
26. That journaliing is praying on paper. And every prayer is heard.
27. That a geniunely rich life costs a lot less than you think.
28. That some people in business will tell you they'll do amazing things for you, but once the deal is signed, they'll ned up doing nothing for you.
29. That the activities and places that fill you with joy are the activities and places where your wisdom wishes you to be.
30. That the best use of money is to create experiences and memories and not to secure objects and possessions.
31. That willpower is built by doing difficult things. So do more difficult things. (Daily).
32. That it's better to read a few books deeply than consume many books lightly.
33. That hardship is the birthplace of heroism. Honor your scars as they have made you you.
34. That the majority of human beings have wonderful hearts and they'll show them to you if you make them feel safe.
35. That elderly people have the best stories. And deserve the highest respect.
36. That all life has huge value. Don't ever step on a spider.
37. That when you feel most alone, our higher power is closes to you.
38. That not every hour of the day and not every day of the week needs to be used "productively" and "grinding". Taking naps, starring at the stars and, sometimes, doing nothing are pursuits absolutely necessary for a life of unlimited beauty.
39. That respecting yourself is vastly more important than being liked by others.
40. That life's too short to play small with your highness.
