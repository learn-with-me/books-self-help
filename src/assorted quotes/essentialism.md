Essentialism advocates for focusing on what truly matters by eliminating non-essential distractions. Here's a summary:

1. **Focus on the Essential**: Essentialism emphasizes identifying and prioritizing what is truly important in your life or work. It's about discerning what really matters and saying no to everything else.

2. **Eliminate the Non-Essential**: McKeown suggests cutting out non-essential activities, commitments, and possessions that don't contribute significantly to your goals or well-being. This creates more space for what truly matters.

3. **Say No More Often**: Learning to say no to non-essential requests and distractions is crucial in embracing essentialism. It allows you to invest your time and energy in the most valuable pursuits.

4. **Create Space for What Matters**: By eliminating the clutter of non-essential activities and commitments, you create space to focus deeply on the things that bring the most fulfillment and value to your life.

Overall, essentialism is about simplifying your life, making deliberate choices, and focusing your efforts on the things that truly matter most to you.
