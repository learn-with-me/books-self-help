## Fear Truth

1. The fear will never go away as long as you continue to grow!
2. The only way to get rid of the fear of doing something is to go out and... do it!
3. The only way to feel better about yourself is to go out and... do it!
4. Not only are you afraid when facing the unknown, so is everyone else!
5. Pushing through fear is less frieghtening than living with the bigger underlying fear that comes from a feeling of helplessness!

## Boudaries & Ownership

The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say "No" to almost everything - Warren Buffet

Your personal boundaries are invisible to other people until they push against them. How you respond in that moment tells that person a lot about you. And if you really want people to stay clear of your personal boudaries then it's your responsibility to tell other people where to find them.

## Thoughts & Beliefs

```
Your belief become your thougths,
Your thoughts become your words,
Your words become your actions,
Your actions become your habits,
Your habits become your values,
Your values become your destiny
```

What you believe is what locks you in for the better or for the worse.

## Perfection & Procrastination

A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made fro him by circumstance - Hunter S Thompson

## You the Creator

Life isn't about finding yourself; life is about creating yourself - George Bernard Shaw

You think that you're doing OK when life is going your way, and you beat yourself up when you're off course. You should be switching your thinking around! When life is OK, you're cruising, your autopilot is doing nothing because there's nothing for it to do. You're playing safe, staying in your comfort zone.

When life is heading off course, you're noticing! You're aware that you need to make a correction! This is good - this is normal. It's what your autopilot was designed to do. So embrace these feelings and realise that you have an opportunity to make a course correction.
