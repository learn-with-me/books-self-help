If there is anything you can count on, it's that life is filled with unexpected changes. You never plan on losing, but stuff happens.

You read \"In case of emergency, break glass\". Think of your emergency fund the same way. A real emergency is something that threatens your survival, not just your desire to be comfortable.</p> <p>Rule #3: Don't let it stay buried. Set it and forget it. Put it in a money market account earning a reasonable return. The goal is not to make the most money out of it, but keeping it simple, safe and yet grow. You're actually buying a <code>money market fund</code> - a mutual fund that invests in the safest and most liquid securities there are: very short-term government bonds and sometimes highly rated corporate bonds. Do not save it in your regular bank account to avoid temptations. Out of sight, out of mind.</p> <p>Rule #4: As life goes on, your expenses may go up as well. Periodically <code>revise your estimates and adjust</code> your stash size accordingly.</p> <p>Rule #5: Make the deposit automatic/recurring/systematic.</p> <p>Remember: the rich get richer because they make their money work for them.</p> <p>Money market accounts are considered to be the safest investments around.
